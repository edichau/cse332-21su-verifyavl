# Verify AVL

## Setting up

Clone this repo, edit it locally, and push and upload to Gradescope, exactly as in P1. We recommend using Java 11 when working on this. You should only edit `verifyavl.VerifyAVL.java` and do not change the method signature. Though, feel free to add private methods as you see fit.


## The assignment
Write Java code for an Î˜(n) worst-case algorithm that verifies that a tree is actually an AVL tree in `./src/verifyavl.VerifyAVL.java`.

You may assume the nodes of the tree have the following definition given in `./src/verifyavl.AVLNode.java`.

You must verify the BST Property, the AVL Balance Condition, and the correctness of the height information. If it fails *any* of these properties, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.

You can assume that the keys and heights will not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. 

## Grading
We will be running an autograder with **many hidden test cases** to grade your submission. You will receive points for each test case you pass. The points will be weighted more heavily on our stress tests, so note that the majority of the points you can get require that your code works without question.

## Testing
We've given you a testing harness in `./test/VerifyAvlTests`. It reads in `./tests.json` and tests your verifyavl.VerifyAVL method on the given tree.

The `./tests.json` file contains as many test cases as you wish to add, where each case is on a separate line with the following format:
  `{"answer": true, "tree": [5,1,[2,0,null,null], [6,0,null,null]]}`

Note that the array representation of an verifyavl.AVLNode is as follows:
`[int key, int height, [verifyavl.AVLNode left], [verifyavl.AVLNode right]]`

So the example above is of a tree with a root node with key 5, a left child node with a key 2, and a right child node with a key 6.

We have provided you with 4 basic test cases:
- A correct AVL tree: `[5,1,[2,0,null,null], [6,0,null,null]]`
![Correct AVL](./img/correct.png)
- A tree that violates the BST property: `[1,1,[2,0,null,null],null]`
![Incorrect BST](./img/bst.png)
- A tree with incorrect height labels: `[2,1,[1,0,null,null],[4,1,[3,0,null,null],null]]`
![Incorrect heights](./img/height.png)
- A tree that violates the AVL balance property: `[2,3,[1,0,null,null],[4,2,[3,0,null,null],[5,1,null,[6,0,null,null]]]]`

**Note: You should add as many test cases as you need to convince yourself that your solution works. Think about edge cases! Your tests will not be graded, but if your code does not work, testing will help you find the problems before we grade it.**
